# AI AI Mods

Modding character behavior in AI SHoujo.

## LessSurprise

Characters may be surprised, but they won't stop what they're doing. They also won't be surprised again for a while (10m).

## MoreLocationInteraction

Characters will interact more with furniture. Open the plugin settings to change the rate - a higher number will make them do more stuff. All this really does is increase the "Game" desire faster - it's controlled by personality and stuff normally.

## MoreMasturbate

Normally characters only masturbate if they run out of motivation when they have a high H desire, otherwise they always look for MC or failing that another character.  With this plugin they will randomly seek to masturbate first.  Control how often this happens as a percent in the plugin options.

# LessClothes

Makes characters undress more when doing various things.  Settings in plugin options.

# How to use
- To install copy the .dll to BepInEx\plugins.
- Needs at least BepInEx 5.0 and AIAPI v1.9.4. Latest game patch is also recommended.
- Start character maker and go to the Body > Overall tab. You should see a new "Male walking animations" toggle, like in the preview picture.
- To change this feature in a character that you already added to your save, you have to find a character change terminal and edit the character there.
